# Testing

With the development of the high-speed testing capabilities of the CLSDK, a new era of thoroughness in smart contract testing is available for those working on EOSIO blockchain applications.

The EOS Power Network uses test-driven development (TDD) via the CLSDK as a standard operating procedure to help ensure the correctness of all state managed by the EOS Power Network. 

Specifically, [BDD-style testing](http://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd/) is used to make it easier to read, write, and understand test logic.
